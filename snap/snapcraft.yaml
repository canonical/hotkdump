summary: Easily open and analyze linux kernel crash dumps. # 79 char long summary
description: |
  hotkdump allows automatic analysis of Linux kernel crash dumps generated
  with `kdump`. It also acts as a crash launcher by automatically downloading
  the required `.ddeb` file for the crash file's kernel version, making it easier
  for end user to open the kernel dumps.

  hotkdump has an bundled version of `crash` available inside the package, and will
  use that by default. It can also use the user-specified `crash` when needed.
